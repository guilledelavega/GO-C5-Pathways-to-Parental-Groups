# Conversion tables for mapping GO TERMS C5 pathways from GSEA to Parental Groups

Using the rrvgo R package, which leverages semantic similarity to cluster and reduce redundancy among Gene Ontology terms, we processed and formatted the resulting tables to link pathways to their corresponding GOBP names and GO IDs. This produces streamlined conversion tables that facilitate the summarization and interpretation of functional blocks of pathways, enabling a clearer, higher-level view of biological processes.
