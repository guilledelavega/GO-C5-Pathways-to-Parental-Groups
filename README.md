# 🧬 GO-C5 Pathways → Parental Groups Conversion Tables  

Using the **rrvgo** R package, which leverages *semantic similarity* to cluster and reduce redundancy among **Gene Ontology (GO)** terms, we processed and formatted tables that link pathways to their corresponding GO names and IDs.  

Reduction was performed using a **similarity threshold of 0.7**, meaning that GO terms sharing ≥70% semantic similarity were grouped under a representative *“parent”* term.  
This approach streamlines redundant GO terms into coherent functional blocks, facilitating biological interpretation at a higher level.  

These conversion tables allow users to easily build customized plots or summaries, adapting the functional grouping to their specific analyses or visualization needs.

### 🧩 Reproducibility  
All tables were generated from **MSigDB C5 gene sets** (`GO:BP`, `GO:MF`, `GO:CC`) using:  
- [`rrvgo`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/rrvgo/) for semantic reduction  
- [`msigdbr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=msigdbr) for GO term retrieval  
- [`org.Hs.eg.db`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/org.Hs.eg.db/) for ontology mapping  

**Similarity method:** `Rel`  
**Threshold:** `0.7` (medium reduction)  
**Organism:** *Homo sapiens* 🧍‍♂️
